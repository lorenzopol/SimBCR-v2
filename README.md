# SimBCR
Python script for simulating recombinant receptor 3D structure. 

## Develop timeline from 02/12/23 on:
- [x] Simulate variable regions with this [R project](https://github.com/GreiffLab/immuneSIM)
- [ ] Refine constant region sequences internal db
- [ ] AlphaFold. Currently using [SWISS-MODEL](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive) in order to get the 3d structure from the aminoacid sequence (check below for more information). 
- [ ] Dreaming of a custom OpenGL based 3D renderer for custom display of folded protein
